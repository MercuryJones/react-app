Wind through tranquil forest roads and sun-dappled overlooks before arriving at the heart of the property—a stunning lakeside retreat designed for both relaxation and adventure.

        Our private 4-bedroom lakehouse combines rustic charm with modern luxury. Floor-to-ceiling windows reveal sweeping views of the water and mountains beyond, while the spacious outdoor deck invites you to gather with friends and family. Whether you seek serene mornings on the dock or lively evenings by the outdoor fireplace, Mountainside Drive provides an unforgettable escape.

        From outdoor water sports to cozy fireside gatherings, this is your perfect destination to recharge, reconnect, and immerse yourself in the natural beauty of North Carolina’s landscape.
